Ideas for anyone willing to finish this vaporware (nah, i'll probably work on it some days)

Spamminess score based system
Compare comment with readability (Using Gunning-Fog/Flesch-Kinicad) of surrounding (parent?) approved comments and main post
Look for grammatical correctness, not just random keywords
Discredit comments that blatantly use incorrect syntax (<a HTML links when BBCode only)
Browser User-Agents (Very insignifigantly discredit browsers unknown and old versions of IE)
Language (Discredit for things in different language, some languages more?)
Discredit certian links by identifier. Forums/Blogs/esp. Profiles are much more likely to be hacked/used for spamming
Discredit subdomains (spammier than normal domains)
Discredit known "free hosts"
Discredit certian TLDs (.info/free)
Discred it username resembles URL
discredit lists (words < 9 characters, seperated by spaces or hyphens, not commas)
Check Vowel ratio for post/username/email
Check protocals, make sure they're HTTP/HTTPS
Check number of links (self-explanatory)
Precedents from author (Good/Bad)
URL Length (large = bad)
Keyword (usual)
Body length, < 20 characters = bad, >20 = good, certain bayesian-discovered length = bad
Base strictness of spam filtering on current spam input
Count words repeated from the original post
